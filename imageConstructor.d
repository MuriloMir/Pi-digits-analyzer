/*
    This program will read a file containing the number pi with a billion digits, then it will use the digits to create images and see what random
    images are formed with the random digits of pi, we will use a technique which takes the first 3 pi digits to make the R, then the next 3 pi
    digits to make the G and then the next 3 pi digits to make the B, thus creating RGB, which is what we need to make a pixel, then we will gather
    10000 of those pixels to make an image which is 100x100 pixels, since each pixel is made up of 3 numbers, R, G and B, we will need 3 * 10,000
    numbers to make all pixels, being a total of 30,000 numbers, and since each of those numbers has 3 digits (3 to make the R, 3 to make the G and
    3 to make the B) we will need 3 * 30,000 digits, being a total of 90000 digits per each image.
